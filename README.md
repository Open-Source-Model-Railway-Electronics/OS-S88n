# OS-S88n-CS

The OS-S88n modules provide feedback functionality for DCC model railroads using the standardized S88n protocol. These modules allow real-time monitoring of block occupancy and layout events by sending data to your command station or PC-based software.

Models:
    • OS-S88n GND — Standard input module using ground-contact detection  
    • OS-S88n CS — current-sensing module  
    • OS-S88n OPTO — Opto-isolated module for clean, noise-free sensor inputs  

All versions include:
    • Daisy-chainable S88n connectors (RJ-45)  
    • Screw terminals for simple input wiring  
    • Compatibility with all major command stations and software (iTrain, Rocrail, Windigipet, etc.)
